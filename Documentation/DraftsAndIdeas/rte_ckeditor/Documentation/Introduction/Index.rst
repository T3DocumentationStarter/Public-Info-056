What does it do?
================

The extension rte_ckeditor provides a Rich Text Editor (RTE) by integrating
`CKEditor <https://ckeditor.com/>`__ into TYPO3.

CKEditor is a WYSIWYG Editor mostly written in JavaScript, and is used in many system
due to its flexibility. There are hundreds of free open-source plugins for CKEditor
to enhance the editing experience.

Integration in TYPO3
====================

Before TYPO3 v8, a custom fork of “HtmlArea”, another open-source WYSIWYG editor
was shipped with TYPO3 Core in a separate extension “rtehtmlarea”. The latter
extension is still fully functional, but must be installed separately via the
TYPO3 Extension Repository or the upgrade tool when updating from previous
TYPO3 versions.

For new installations CKEditor is activated by default and ships with a
default configuration for editors. To enable CKEditor on an existing installation
in TYPO3 v8, visit the Extension Manager in the TYPO3 Backend and disable
“rtehtmlarea” and enable “rte_ckeditor”.

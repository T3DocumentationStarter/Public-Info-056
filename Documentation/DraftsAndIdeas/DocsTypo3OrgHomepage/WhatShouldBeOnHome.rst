Concept: What should be on the Homepages?
=========================================

Common best practices
=====================

* A lot more on the start page, you don't have to click in any submenu, you can
  access the most basic stuff from one page
* A "Getting Started" section
* A section "Architecure Concepts"



Other docs
==========

What do other docs have on their docs start page?

Wordpress
---------

What is worthy of imitation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* has a small table of contents on the start page (of a specific guide in this example,
  see `Plugin API <https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API>`__
  Advantages:

  * You don't have an entire Sitemap on one page like we often do, which is overwhelming
    because it contains far too much information.
  * you don't waste space with only a few sentences on one page, as we often do

Ideas and Suggestions
=====================

* find a set of aspects how docs should be reviewed, e.g.
  * linguistically correct (spelling, grammar, style, does it sound like native English?)
  * technically correct
  * comprehensible, easy to read
  * complete (if a new concept is introduced, is the documentation sufficient to understand the concept?)

* Use a consistent set of labels in TYPO3 documentation github projects for issues, e.g.
  * needs_editing_techi (editing required: technically correct?)
  * needs_editing_style (editing required: grammar, spelling, style)
  * needs_editing_clarity (the text is not understandable enough or lacks explanations)
  * needs_editing_deprecated (the text / code samples contain deprecated things)
  * new (Issue for something missing, which needs someone to write a new text)
  
* find a workflow to work on TYPO3 documentation, preferably something including a review
  process
  * how can manuals / individual pages be marked as "done", "needs work", etc
  * it would be preferable to have several people proofread / review documentation, how could this be coordinated?
    
* What should be documented and what should go into which manual? What is missing?
  * rename "Core API" (as already mentioned in channel)
  * provide an "Introduction to TYPO3 Architecture" chapter in "Core API" which should 
    explain basic concepts (but not go into detail). Should include an overview of TCA,
    DataHandler, TSFE, Fluid, FormEngine and how these things play together
  * explain / provide a reference or introduction to basic terms (as in my draft `Glossary
    ttps://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/drafts/github/T3DocumentationStarter/Public-Info-056/DraftsAndIdeas/Glossary.html>`__
 
* Improve landing pages
  * improve start page docs.typo3.org
    * Seperation of Guides and References helpful? 
 
 * Things that could generally be improved:
  * sometimes the docs are great for details, but introductory text is missing
    or not in the places where they are needed. Examples
    * fluid: https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/ExtbaseGuide/Fluid/Index.html
    *

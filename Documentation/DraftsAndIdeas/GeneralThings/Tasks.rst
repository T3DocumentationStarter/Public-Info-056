Some of My Completed Tasks
==========================

  see `news <https://docs.typo3.org/News/2019/Index.html#new-documentation-for-rte-ckeditor>`__
* Wrote chapter about Locking API (in TYPO3 Explained), see
  `news <https://docs.typo3.org/News/2019/Index.html#new-documentation-of-locking-api>`__

  See `news <https://docs.typo3.org/News/2019/Index.html#improvements-for-documentation-contributors>`__

Contribution Guide
------------------

* Restructured some chapters to reflect the order of when someone needs the information

  * e.g. page on Gerrit is split into general overview and more advanced topics you usually
    need **after** you submitted a patch

* Added information about :ref:`Slack and events <t3contrib:how-to-get-help>`
* Added `cheat sheet <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/ContributionWorkflowGuide/CheatSheets/Git.html>`__
* Added information about `debugging <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/ContributionWorkflowGuide/DebuggingTypo3/Index.html>`__
* Added information about documenting: rendering

Extension Documentation
-----------------------

* Made some changes to example extension manual:

  * Converted TABs to spaces
  * Added links to official documentation

* Added chapter :ref:`h2document:how-to-start-docs-extension` in "Writing Documentation"
  (see section "Writing Documentation")

Clarity, structure
------------------

* moved advanced tips about writing documentation from startpage of docs.typo3.org to start page of
  "Writing Documentation"
* added beginner tips to startpage on https://docs.typo3.org
* Added links to additional versions on `list of core documentation <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/References/Index.html>`__
* Added `"Usage tips" <https://docs.typo3.org/Tips/UsingThisSite/Index.html>`__
  (note: it would be preferable to improve usability, then we wouldn't need "Usage
  Tips", until then this is a workaround)

Deduplication
-------------

* merged some information on docs.typo3.org "glue pages" to "Writing Documentation", added links
* Migrated stuff from the Wiki, reduced text in Wiki to stub and added link, see `Moved <https://wiki.typo3.org/Category:Moved>`__
  for all Wiki pages with Category "Moved", not all done by me, of course.


Maintainance
------------

* Migrated several issues from Forge to GitHub
* Cleaned up `doc section on Forge <https://forge.typo3.org/projects/team-docteam>`__
* Added .editorconfig in several manuals
* added Readme.rst in several manuals
* added CONTRIBUTING.rst in
  several manuals

==============================
Method: 1-2-3 With Big Numbers
==============================


first found in form extension docs: https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/form/QuickStart/Index.html

.. rst-class:: bignums-xxl

1. pro

   * good division between parts
   * numbering makes it easier to follow

2. con

   * not in menu, so you can't jump to specific section from menu
   * no named anchor so you can't link directly to section

3. conlusion

   **Good method if there are not too many items (up to 5 is ok).
   It is probably a good idea to use this consistently throughout
   the documentation, e.g. for a Quick start section**
